<p class="boxtext"> <strong> What is a climate response surface? </strong> </p>

<p class="boxtext" style="font-size:12px"> A climate response surface is a simple tool to visualize the results of a <em> climate stress test </em> from a decision-scaling analysis (Brown et al., 2012). It relates performance indicators of interest such as water supply reliability to key climate parameters such as changes in  mean precipitation and temperature.  </p>

<p class="boxtext" style="font-size:12px"> After establishing the climate response maps, the best-available evidence about future climate conditions such as climate projections can be overlayed onto the map for assessing the plausibility. </p>
