<h4> Climate Response Surface </h4>

<p> A climate response map relates performance indicators of interest (e.g. water supply reliability) to key climate parameters (e.g. changes in  mean precipitation and temperature). After establishing the climate response maps, the best-available evidence about future climate      conditions (e.g. climate projections or historical trends) can be overlayed onto the response maps. Combining the available information in this way, we aim to answer if there is credible evidence indicating unacceptable performance and whether the confidence level of the analysis is sufficient to make a risk-informed decision. </p>
